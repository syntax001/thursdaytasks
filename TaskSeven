/* TASK SEVEN
7.a create an integer called input and assign it a value of 20. use a loop to print the value and all values from there, until it reaches 0, 
with the following exceptions:
if the number is 6, instead print the string "six".
Once the number is half of the input value, print "HALF!"
7.b Run exercise 7.a again with a different input value and make sure it still works. You should also consider if it will work with a negative input, e.g. -20.*/


int input = 20;
String six = "SIX!";
String half = "HALF!";

for (int i = input; i >= 0; i--) {
  if (i == 6) {
    println(six);
  } else if (i == input / 2) {
    println(half);
  } else
  println(i);
}
