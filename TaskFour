/* TASK FOUR
4.a print out numbers from 0 to 20 using a for loop.
4.b alter the for loop from 4.a to only print even numbers (hint: google 'java modulus even number')
4.c print out the same result as in task 4.b using a while loop instead of a for loop.*/

// for loop printing 0-20
for (int countToTwenty = 0; countToTwenty < 21; countToTwenty += 1) {


// if countToTwenty / 2 = 0, then its an even number, meaning it will print
  if (countToTwenty % 2 == 0) {
    println(countToTwenty);
  }
}

// While loop
int whileTwenty = 0;
while (whileTwenty < 21) {
  println(whileTwenty);
  whileTwenty += 1;
}
